***Unveiling Customer Churn Detection with Autoencoders: A Deep Dive into Predictive Analytics***

**Introduction-**
In today's highly competitive market, customer churn has become a significant concern for businesses, especially in the banking sector. It refers to the loss of customers or clients who have stopped doing business with a company. Detecting customer churn in advance is crucial for banks to take proactive measures to retain their customers. 
In this blog post, we embark on a journey into the realm of artificial intelligence, focusing on one of its innovative techniques: autoencoders. Specifically, we explore how autoencoders can be harnessed to address the pressing challenge of detecting customer churn.
Customer churn detection, a vital task in the realm of customer relationship management, involves identifying customers who are likely to discontinue their association with a business. Whether it's predicting subscription cancellations, contract terminations, or service abandonment, the ability to automatically detect customer churn holds significant implications for industries ranging from telecommunications to subscription-based services.
At the heart of this endeavor lies the autoencoder, a sophisticated neural network architecture renowned for its ability to learn efficient representations of data. Autoencoders operate by encoding input data into a lower-dimensional latent space and then decoding it back into its original form, enabling the extraction of meaningful patterns and features from complex datasets.
Throughout this blog post, we'll unravel the inner workings of autoencoders, from data preprocessing to training and evaluating a model capable of accurately identifying customers at risk of churn. Along the way, we'll delve into essential concepts such as anomaly detection, model architecture design, loss functions, and evaluation metrics.
So, join us as we delve into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and witness firsthand the transformative power of autoencoders in a bank’s customer churn detection. Whether you're an aspiring data scientist eager to learn or a seasoned professional seeking advanced insights, this blog post promises to enlighten and inspire your journey in the captivating realm of machine learning and customer analytics.

**Reading the data –** 
For this project, I am using the Customer_Churn.csv. The dataset consists of various variables such as customer ID, age, gender, account balance, credit score, etc. It also has the binary variable “Churned”  which is 1 if the customer churned and 0 if they did not. It consists of 9000 observations and 13 variables. The response variable is imbalanced with number of customers churned being 1822 and the customers that did not churn being 7178.

 

**Data Pre-processing –**
After reading in the data, looking at the summary and checking for any missing variables the next step in data pre-processing is dropping the unnecessary variables from the dataset that are not relevant to detecting customer churn. For instance, variables such as CustomerID and Lastname do not provide any useful information in detecting customer churn, and hence can be dropped.
After dropping the irrelevant variables, the next step is to dummy-encode the categorical variables into numeric variables. Variables such as Geography and Gender in the dataset were dummy encoded from this dataset. Then we created the X and Y matrices for the autoencoders.

**Scaling the data-**
Scaling the data is a crucial preprocessing step when using autoencoders in machine learning applications. By scaling the data to a similar range, we ensure that the optimization algorithm converges efficiently during training. This prevents features with larger numerical ranges (such as estimated salary or balance) from dominating the learning process, leading to more balanced and robust representations. 
Scaling also enhances the performance of the autoencoder model by allowing it to focus on capturing the underlying structure and patterns in the data. Furthermore, scaled data facilitates interpretation of the learned representations and ensures compatibility with activation functions and loss functions used in the autoencoder architecture. 
Here I have used the MinMaxScaler function from sklearn.preprocessing to scale the data X (without the response variable). MinMax Scaler standardizes the variables to be a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 1. 

**Fitting an AutoEncoder-**
In this part, we delve into the intricacies of deep learning by constructing and training an autoencoder architecture using TensorFlow and Keras. The autoencoder is a powerful neural network model renowned for its ability to learn efficient representations of complex data. Our Sequential model begins with an input layer shaped to match the dimensions of the input data, denoted as X. This layer serves as the entry point for our autoencoder.
Following the input layer, we add Dense layers with ReLU activation functions. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is chosen for its ability to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex relationships within the data. The number of neurons in these layers gradually decreases, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the data and creating a bottleneck in the network.
To prevent overfitting and improve the generalization capabilities of the model, we incorporate Dropout layers after each Dense layer. Dropout randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons during training, forcing the model to learn redundant representations and enhancing its robustness to noise. We haves set it at 10%
As we progress through the architecture, the dimensionality of the data is progressively reduced from 11 to 6 until it reaches the bottleneck layer (3 neurons), which contains the lowest number of neurons. This bottleneck layer serves as a compressed representation of the input data, capturing its essential features in a lower-dimensional space.
Finally, the output layer of the autoencoder is configured to have the same shape as the input data (X), with a sigmoid activation function. The sigmoid activation function ensures that the reconstructed output falls within a bounded range, making it suitable for tasks such as image reconstruction or anomaly detection.
After constructing the autoencoder architecture, we compile the model using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss function. The Adam optimizer is chosen for its efficiency in optimizing neural network models, while the MSE loss function quantifies the difference between the input and reconstructed output, guiding the training process towards minimizing reconstruction error. Through careful parameter adjustments and multiple epochs of training, our autoencoder autoencoder learns to minimize the reconstruction error between the input and reconstructed output, effectively learning to compress and reconstruct the input data while preserving its essential features. 
 
**Determining 500 customers most likely to churn-** 
Following the training of the autoencoder model, our focus shifts to leveraging its predictive capabilities to identify customers most likely to churn. By utilizing the reconstructed data obtained from the autoencoder, we can compute the reconstruction error, which quantifies the disparity between the original input data and its reconstructed counterpart. Specifically, the mean squared error (MSE) metric serves as a reliable measure of this difference, enabling us to pinpoint customers with high reconstruction errors indicative of potential churn.
Once we have calculated the reconstruction error for each customer, we proceed to sort them in a descending order based on their error values. This sorting process allows us to prioritize customers with the highest reconstruction errors, signaling a greater likelihood of churn. By selecting the top 500 customers with the highest reconstruction errors, we can effectively pinpoint those most at risk of attrition, facilitating targeted retention efforts to mitigate churn and preserve customer loyalty.

**Verifying the accuracy -**
Having identified the 500 most likely to churn customers, the next critical step involves validating the accuracy of our predictions. This entails comparing our churn predictions with the actual churn status of customers to ascertain the effectiveness of our model. By cross-referencing our predictions with ground truth churn labels, we can calculate the detection rate, also known as recall, of our model. This evaluation metric provides valuable insights into the model's performance in accurately identifying true churn cases, guiding the refinement of our churn prediction strategies and bolstering confidence in our predictive capabilities.
In summary, leveraging the reconstruction error computed using MSE, we can effectively identify customers at high risk of churn and validate the accuracy of our churn predictions. This systematic approach enables businesses to prioritize proactive retention efforts, minimize customer attrition, and foster long-term customer relationships, ultimately driving sustainable growth and success in competitive markets.
Additionally, it's noteworthy to mention that the detection rate (recall) achieved in this analysis was 8.7%. While this may not be optimal, it underscores the potential of leveraging autoencoders for tasks like customer churn prediction, offering valuable insights and paving the way for further refinement and improvement in predictive performance.
